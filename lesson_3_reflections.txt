When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    when i want to publish it to help other people with it or to share it with other developers to help each other in the
    developing process by making a new remote that works as the staging area as an intermediate between the local repository
    and the on i have created on githup using the `git remote add $remote_name$ $githup_URL$` command and use `git remote`
    to see all remotes i have made and at last to push/bull them using the `git push $remote_name$ $bransh_name$` command
    to bush the new commits made to the branch.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because i may don't want the changes on github get reflected to my local repository as these changes may have been done by other
	developer that i don't want to commit to my project also it's a waste to the resources(Internet) that it would be updating every
	couple of minutes or so.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Cloning: is making a copy from a github repository to your local repository to make a modification on it off-line
	Branching: is making a new product line to make a modification to the code without breaking it and to make a new feature
	Forking: is making a copy of a github repository to your github repository without having to clone it to your local machine
