What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When initializing a repository it creates a hidden folder called (.git) to track the repository, to store the 
	history of my project or folder and can be checked by running `git status` to check the track history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	It's an intermediate area between the working directory and the commit, so that you can add/remove files to/from
	it before making the commit change.
	It allows me to control the commit as to add one or more files to the same commit, hence control the logical
	flow of my project.
